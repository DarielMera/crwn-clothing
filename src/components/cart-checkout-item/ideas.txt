OVERVIEW : CHECK OUT BUTTON FUNCTIONALITY

---------CHECK OUT BUTTON--------
- declare router inside app
- declare link inside navigation
- onclick it redirect me to the check out page
- dont forge the outlet ( i think is already there)

----- COMPONENT DECLARATIONS -----
- use cart-context for data coming from cartItems
- declare cart-checkout-items
- declare cart-checkout-lists
- map thru cartItems array and from each iteration call the cart checkout item components 


- follow visual components ideas for structure
- see ideas from other components
- see ideas from the provided css file 


- should i use grid ? 

----CHEVRON FEATURES-----
- figure out how to use the chevron arrows left and right 
- ex: &u9123 or use google icons
- quantity: comes from the updated cartItems array
- I should call the same function in context that allows to add to quantity
- but also substract to quantity


- from the visual i conclude 
    1. top info is statick
    2. from cartItems I will need : imageUrl, name, quantity, price
    3. also an x that will remove the component
